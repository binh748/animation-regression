# Predicting Global Box Office Revenue for Japanese and American Animated Films

For my [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps) regression project, I built two separate linear regression models to predict global box office revenue for American and Japanese animated films, respectively.

## Lessons Learned

My American regression model performed okay with a test R-squared of .66, but my Japan model was a failure with a test R-squared of almost zero. This project taught me a number of lessons, which have helped me improve my subsequent Metis projects. 

1. Think carefully about what data I need to scrape beforehand since re-scraping data is time-expensive.
2. Do residual analysis throughout the modeling process, not at the very end.
3. Find additional/better data sources if the data source Iâ€™m working with is inadequate.
4. Give myself enough time to work on my PowerPoint presentation and be deliberate in the design, data visualizations, and storytelling.
